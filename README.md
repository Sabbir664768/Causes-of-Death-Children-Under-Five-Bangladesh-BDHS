# Causes-of-Death-Children-Under-Five-Bangladesh-BDHS

**Abstract**

**Background**

To improve children's chances of survival, we need to understand what's causing their deaths. This study explores the factors leading to mortality among children under five in Bangladesh.

**Methods**

This study investigated the causes of death among children under five in Bangladesh using data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) of 2011 and 2017-2018. The BDHS employed a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design to achieve national representativeness. Verbal autopsy interviews were conducted to determine the cause of death based on information from family members or caregivers. The cause of death was assigned by a panel of three physicians using the ICD-10 coding system. Data from DHS survey was used to examine the number of deaths, proportional mortality ratios, and the impact of various factors on child mortality. DHS surveys employ sampling weights, adjusted for unequal selection probabilities and differential response rates, to accurately represent the population by correcting for oversampling and nonresponse bias in statistical analyses.

**Findings**

According to the study, Pneumonia, birth asphyxia, preterm birth, and drowning were leading causes. Disparities existed by age, gender, location, and maternal age. Neonates had the highest mortality risk. Male children and those in rural areas faced higher risks. Dhaka and Chittagong divisions had the highest prevalence of deaths. Young adult mothers and adolescents mothers were most affected. Despite increased antenatal care, significant child deaths continued to occur, indicating a deficiency in healthcare quality.

**Interpretation**

The study identified pneumonia, birth asphyxia, infections, and preterm birth as major causes of under-five mortality in Bangladesh, with higher risks in rural areas, densely populated regions, and the neonatal period. Improving healthcare, particularly in rural regions, addressing child marriage, and promoting child health awareness are crucial for reducing child deaths.
